  **Warning: content spoilers below!**
### 0.6.8
* General
    * Added a new "rulebook" section to the character select screen, inspired by ruleset settings of Starstorm 1 and Risk of Rain Returns. The intent is to allow players to customize runs in major ways that are less significant than artifacts, without needing to manually edit a config.
* Items / Equipment
    * Added: Broken Blood Tester*, Diary*, Guarding Amulet, Universal Charger, Ice Tool, Cryptic Source, Man-o'-War, Strange Can*, Rainbow Root, Composite Injector, Erratic Gadget*, Simple Magnet, White Flag.
        * Items marked with an asterisk were from a previous version of the mod, but have since been reworked. Details of each item can be found on the mod's wiki.

    * Nemesis Invasions ... ??????????????????
* Executioner
    * Reduced base max secondary stocks from 10 to 5. Ideally, this should make the move feel a bit better to use, creating less of a 'hoarding' mindset and functioning better with extra secondary stocks.
* Nemesis Commando
    * Utility no longer goes as far/fast, but now starts with 2 stocks. This should help create a finer sense of control while weaving in and out of combat.
